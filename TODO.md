which-key health check warning on nvim open despite key conflicts not meaningful

- could be fixed with noice nvim plugin filter

SearXNG is implemented via mcphub mcp server. Would be better if it integrated
with codecompanion.nvims @web_search tool.

Tmux ressurect doesn't load nvim sessions propertly due to nix environment

Tmux continuum isn't auto restorting on tmux start

On first codespace load tmux session starts before dotfiles causing tmux config
to not be loaded.
